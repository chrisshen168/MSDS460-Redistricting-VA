# MSDS460-Redistricting-VA

 ## Project Statement:
 The objective of this assignment is to develop a fair and equitable redistricting plan for the state of Virginia using integer programming. Redistricting involves the allocation of counties to legislative districts, ensuring that each district has approximately equal population and adheres to specific fairness criteria. The problem can be framed as a set partitioning problem with binary decision variables. The goal is to maximize "compactness" or minimize "lack of compactness" while respecting certain constraints.
